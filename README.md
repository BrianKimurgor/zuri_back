# Project Title: Stage One Internship Challenge

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create and host an API endpoint using any programming language of your choice. This API endpoint should take two GET request query parameters and return specific information in JSON format.

## Requirements
The required information that the API endpoint should provide includes:
- Slack name
- Current day of the week
- Current UTC time (with validation of +/-2 minutes)
- Track
- The GitHub URL of the file being executed
- The GitHub repo URL of the full source code
- A status code indicating success (200)

Here is an example of the JSON format that the endpoint should return:

```json
{
  "slack_name": "example_name",
    "current_day": "Monday",
      "utc_time": "2023-08-21T15:04:05Z",
        "track": "backend",
          "github_file_url": "https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/file_name.ext",
            "github_repo_url": "https://github.com/username/repo",
              "status_code": 200
              }
              ```

              ## Acceptance Criteria
              To successfully complete this challenge, you need to meet the following criteria:

              ### Endpoint Creation
              - Provide a publicly accessible endpoint.

              ### GET Parameters
              - The endpoint should accept two GET request query parameters: `slack_name` and `track`. For example: `http://example.com/api?slack_name=example_name&track=backend`.

              ### Slack Name
              - The response should include the `slack_name` passed as a GET request query parameter.

              ### Current Day of the Week
              - Display the current day of the week in full (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).

              ### Current UTC Time
              - Return the current UTC time, accurate within a +/-2 minute window.

              ### Track
              - The response should display the track that you signed up for (e.g., "Backend"). This will be based on the `track` GET parameter passed to the endpoint.

              ### GitHub File URL
              - Include a direct link to the specific file in the GitHub repository that's being executed.

              ### GitHub Repo URL
              - Include a link to the main page of the GitHub repository containing the project's entire source code.

              ### Status Code
              - Return a status code of 200 as an integer.

              ### JSON Format
              - The endpoint's response should adhere to the specified JSON format.

              ### Testing
              - Before submission, ensure the endpoint is accessible.
              - Check the returned JSON against the defined format.
              - Validate the correctness of each data point in the JSON response.

              ## Submission Guidelines
              Please follow these submission guidelines:
              1. Contact via direct message.
              2. Type `/grade <your-api-endpoint-url-with-the-query-parameters>` in the message.
                 - For example: `/grade http://example.com/api?slack_name=example_name&track=backend`.
                 3. Check your result.
